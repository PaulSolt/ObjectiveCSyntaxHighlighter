#Objective C Syntax Highlighter
The Objective C Syntax Highlighter is an extension to [Syntax Highlighter](http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/). This will allow you to push Objective C code to your blog and have it colorize it.

## Setup
Copy shBrushObjC.js to your Syntax Highlighter directory and add the brush in your code.

## Samples
I updated the index.html to show how you can use the new highlighter.
